To run the program, you can

1. execute the "make" command on the command line,
which will build the necessary files for the program. 

2. Then we will run the program with the "make test" command, 
as a result of which the following files will be generated: 
exit.txt, result.txt, and the jacobi.cpp file will run.

3. Use the "make clean" command to clean the object and other generated files.


A description of the program's work is presented in jacobi.h, jacobi.cpp
in the form of comments in files.
